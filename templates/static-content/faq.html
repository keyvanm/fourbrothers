        At Four Brothers, we have the best safety procedures and policies implemented. Not only does Four Brothers have qualified technicians, but only premium tools, equipment and products are used during service calls. The car technician will use a portable safety barrier to ensure no one comes within proximity of the car, as well as secure car jack to lift the vehicle if necessary. Also, our technicians use a heavy duty mat underneath the vehicle to prevent any fluid leaks.

       <h2>xi.  How do I change my requested services? <h2>
       <p> You are allowed to change your requested services and/or products up to 24 hours before your scheduled appointment by accessing your profile account. Unfortunately, you will not be allowed to change your requested services the same day as your scheduled appointment with some exceptions. Once the technician arrives, you can request a change of services and/or for additional services to be completed. The reasoning behind this is that our technicians have pre-determined what supplies and equipment they need and may not be able to obtain the necessary supplies to fulfill your service change request. </p>
      <h2>xii.    How does rescheduling my appointment work?</h2>
      <p> If you choose to reschedule your appointment, you can simply sign-in to your account/profile and choose another date.  Unfortunately, you will not be permitted to change your scheduled appointment the same day as your appointment.

As such, you will be charged a missed appointment fee which is the lesser of your appointment cost or $49.99.</p>
